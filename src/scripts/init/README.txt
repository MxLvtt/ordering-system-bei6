HOW TO RUN
==========

In order to be able to run the script "database_init.sh", execute the following commands.

$ chmod +x database_init.sh
$ sudo ./database_init.sh

NOTE: Make sure that the password for the "root" user of mysql is correct.
Run the script once, to see what the password should be! After the script has
executed, you will no longer be able to log in to mysql with the "root" user
without providing the correct password.
